# Simple Shell

The project is a simple UNIX command interpreter written as part of the low-level programming and algorithm track at Alx. The shell works like the sh shell. The functions it handles includes but are not limited to:

* Environment variables handling
* Commands written with their absolute paths
* Commands execution with arguments

This project was done by IWELUMO C JUDE and CHUKWUEMEKA HAVVAH VICTORY  under the supervision of JULIEN BARBIER at Alx.

## Requirements

* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Code uses the Betty linter style

## How to Compile

The code can easily be compiled with gcc in your terminal by GNU Vim.

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

## Usage

Our simple shell works like the sh shell and operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes. here are some usage examples.

**Interactive Mode**

In interactive mode, you simply run the program and it will display a prompt where you can enter your commands, similar to sh.
```bash
$ ./hsh
$ mkdir my_new_directory
$ ls -l
$ cd my_new_directory
$ env
$ exit
$ setenv
```
**Non-Interactive Mode**

Non-interactive mode is when you want to send commands to the program via a pipe, a file, or from a bash script, for example.
Create a new directory:
```bash
$ echo "mkdir my_new_directory" | ./hsh
$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
$ echo "cd my_new_directory" | ./hsh
$ echo "env" | ./hsh
$ echo "exit" | ./hsh
```

```bash
$ mkdir my_new_directory
```
List directory contents:

```bash
$ ls -l
```
Change current directory to a new one:

```bash
$ cd my_new_directory
```
Print environment variables:

```bash
$ env
```
Exit shell:

```bash
$ exit
```
